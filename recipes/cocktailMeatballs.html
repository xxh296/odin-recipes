    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These tasty cocktail meatballs will disappear quickly at your holiday party. My mom makes them every year for New Year's Eve, and now so do I. These do very well in a slow cooker, as you can simmer them before serving and keep them hot for the duration of your party.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>

        </ul>
